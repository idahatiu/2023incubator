## About This Item

The sculpture depicts the Virgin Mary in yellow, which is the color associated with this manifestation of Mary, at sea. Beneath her is a row boat made up if two indigenous brothers from Cuba and an enslaved African child: Rodrigo and Juan de Hoyos and Juan Moreno. The three individuals set out to sea for the purpose of gathering salt for food preservation. They encountered a violent storm. As they prayed for their safety, the skies cleared, the seas calmed and the found a sculpture depicting the Virgin Mary, completely dry despite floating in the sea. The town which adopted the sculpture by building a chapel, El Cobre, was a copper mining town. The base of the sculpture contains reflective specs reminiscent of copper. The top and bottom of the shrine is made of found wood
